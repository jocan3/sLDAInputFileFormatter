have to be set aside to cover the burden of non performing loans Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year But the kingdom s still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable One senior bank credit officer said The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia s corporate sector in 1983 culminating in a number of debt reschedulings has taken a heavy toll of bank profits with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom s banks had sunk to 827 9 mln riyals from 2 66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled Of the kingdom s nine joint venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline or net loss for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions The newest and smallest of the joint ventures United Saudi Commercial Bank USCB reported a 1986 net loss of 15 9 mln riyals marginally less than 1985 s shortfall of 17 0 mln Profits before provisions were sharply higher in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985 Other results released so far show Saudi American Bank SAMBA reporting a 53 8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80 7 mln riyals while Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi known as Saudi French slid 14 pct to 94 9 mln riyals Both Saudi American owned 40 pct by Citicorp s CCI N Citibank NA and Saudi French 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez increased provisions sharply Arab National Bank s net profit fell 17 8 pct to 152 1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86 6 mln riyals Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity but one banker said The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions From 1982 to 1985 the kingdom s largest bank National Commercial Bank NCB stashed away 1 7 billion riyals in provisions or 8 9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector bankers calculated Between 1982 and 1985 Riyad Bank NCB s rival as the second biggest of the two all Saudi shareholding banks had covered 12 8 pct of its loans and advances Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency SAMA has been tightening supervision there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non performing Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres Bankers generally said NCB Riyad Bank and the joint ventures SAMBA Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners Other banks such as Saudi British Bank 40 pct owned by the British Bank of the Middle East are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9 1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported Saudi Cairo Bank after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to Saudi Investment Bank and USCB The banks can on lend these to generate profit but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non performing loans And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products One banker said Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good Reflecting the caution in new lending the amount of advances is showing a declining trend while the days when banks had ample funds in interest free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money In 1979 the ratio of interest bearing accounts to

426897,"U S OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT NEW YORK March 12 Senior U S Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets Beryl Sprinkel chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers reiterated the Reagan Administration s opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth By contrast Rudolph Penner Director of the Congressional Budget Office said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987 Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments He also suggested a line item veto which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it to limit wasteful spending Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2 7 pct growth in U S Real gross national product GNP in 1987 and 3 5 pct in 1988 Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable Sprinkel said It looks pretty good to me We ve had two very strong employment reports He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate adding It looks like they re on track While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives he said Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long run consequences of tax reform Sprinkel said In 1986 this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit In fiscal 1986 ending September federal spending amounted to 23 8 pct of GNP while federal receipts absorbed 18 5 pct of GNP leaving a deficit of 5 3 pct he said Sprinkel said that compared with fiscal 1978 the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2 7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same Contrary to the conventional wisdom therefore the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years Sprinkel said This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981 he added However the Congressional Budget Office s Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress indeed with increases in defence spending now all the options for reducing the budget deficit are unpleasant he said Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U S Caused by the biggest sustained inflation in our nation s history which helped foster widespread distrust of government The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level Penner said But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot Penner sees little hope the Gramm Rudman Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there s no Way to enforce it Penner said Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one time measures such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988 That saved more than two billion dlrs Penner said REUTER ",usa,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.00226244343891403,0,0,0,0,0.00678733031674208,0,0,0,0,0.98868778280543,0.00226244343891403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

when he unveils his budget for fiscal 1987 88 Exceptionally robust tax revenues have given Lawson very favourable budget options with which to please voters industry and financial markets alike The budget will Lawson s fourth and probably the last from the Conservative government before the next general election political analysts say Analysts said the major budget question is how Lawson will balance expected tax cuts with lower public borrowing and allow for fresh falls in U K Interest rates They said a boost given to the economy by consumer spending has helped reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement PSBR for financial 1986 87 from an originally targetted 7 1 billion stg despite big rises in government spending Economists say Lawson may have up to five billion stg to split between income tax cuts and other electoral sweeteners higher spending and a drop in borrowing while still meeting his earlier 1987 88 PSBR target of 7 0 billion stg The decision facing Lawson is how best to use that so called fiscal adjustement to maximise the government s all round popularity ahead of the next general election Economist Ian Harwood of Warburg Securities said Lawson s budget must strike a balance between tax cuts aimed at home consumption and lower public borrowing for attracting support from overseas investors Peter Fellner of James Capel and Co said a budget which concentrates on tax cuts for the consumer will be a budget for an early election Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher must call a poll before June 1988 But anticipation of a summer or autumn 1987 ballot has risen as the opposition Labour Party has slipped in voter surveys Forecasts that the economy may deteriorate later this year add to arguments for an early poll analysts say The Conservatives have pledged to cut the basic rate of taxation in the U K From the current 29 pct level to 25 pct While confirming that aim Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher last month seemed to dash speculation that that would happen in the near future She said in a television interview that it would happen Eventually But I think it will be eventually Most market analysts now expect a two pence reduction in the basic rate of taxation and a lowering in of the top rate of income tax from 60 pct A one billion stg cut in the 1987 88 PSBR to six billion stg is considered the minimum needed for reassuring financial markets they add The Treasury s inflow of tax receipts has far surpassed that previously envisaged economists say Lawson as recently as December 17 said that I very much doubt whether there will be much scope for reductions in taxation in next year s budget The Conservative government is eager to get the basic rate of tax down to 25 pct as soon as possible since every pound off the tax base would make the opposition Labour Party s spending plans look more painful to the electorate analysts say The direct revenue effect of a one penny change in the basic rate of income tax would be about 1 1 billion stg in 1987 88 and 1 45 billion stg in 1988 89 Treasury figures show Lawson s budget speech to Parliament on Tuesday starts at 1530 GMT and is sure to echo the government s distinct tone of optimism analysts say The tax measures which Lawson is expected to announce will be based firmly on a positive assessment of past economic achievements and confidence for the future they add But even if he does cut his planned PSBR for 1987 88 by between one and 1 5 billion stg as most economists predict Lawson is still likely to find himself announcing a higher PSBR than the outturn for this financial year M That could leave him with a presentation problem economists say A lower PSBR would raise financial confidence by reassuring markets that the borrowing burden imposed by the government would stay low even if certain key aspects of the budget s arithmetic seem over optimistic economists say Lawson is slated to reaffirm the government s goals as set out in its Medium Term Financial Strategy MTFS of reducing inflation and raising economic growth Regarding monetary targets some analysts expect him to drop the wayward broad money aggregate sterling M 3 while retaining the tamer M0 narrow measure Few foresee any other monetary aggregate being chosen by Lawson for formal targeting Analysts were surprised this week when the government sanctioned a half percentage point cut in interest rates in an attempt to cool down sterling and the gilts market Analysts had expected the authorities to wait until after the budget Further declines in bank base lending rates are anticipated after the budget Many analysts foresee them falling by as much as a full percentage point from the current 10 5 pct level The main electoral attraction of reducing interest rates is to cut mortgage borrowing costs and thus reduce inflation analysts say Each one percentage point cut in the mortgage rate reduces retail prices by 0 4 pct government figures show REUTER

427044,"FRN PANIC INITIATED EXACERBATED BY MARKET MAKERS By Norma Cohen and Dominique Jackson Reuters LONDON March 13 Today s panic in the floating rate note market has been simmering for months and is in many ways of the market makers own doing traders and bank officials said For the last six months there have been a series of crises in the FRN market Each has cut deeper and deeper into the very fibre of the market said a senior official at a U S Bank As prices have fallen he explained the underwriters who originally brought the issues have retreated They have divested themselves of the paper as quickly as possible unwilling to bear losses of the magnitude seen in recent panic trading In the virtual effective closure of the market for perpetual floaters last month bankers witnessed the consequences of this kind of contraction of liquidity and investor confidence Fears were engendered about the possibility of this crisis infecting the market in conventional dated FRN issues which is almost 10 times as large as that for perpetuals with an estimated 130 billion dlrs of debt outstanding The professionals are so nervous about holding inventory that they will sell at any price said an official at a leading U S Bank explaining the panic selling which has pushed prices down sharply over the last two days Bankers and FRN traders emphasised that today s trading was unique in that it was driven exclusively by professionals and that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the securities they sold In highlighting this point dealers noted that the benchmark issues in the FRN market the two FRN s for the U K Launched in 1985 and 1986 fell an unprecedented 50 and 40 basis points respectively at the opening this morning Certainly dealers said Britain is no less credit worthy today than it was yesterday and the country s economic health currently appears better than it has for some time Pointing out that this kind of sovereign and supra national debt had not sagged on any fundamental weakness one senior FRN source said The idiocy of the situation is aptly shown by the fact that these kind of borrowers can now tap the syndicated loan markets at rates lower than their floaters currently pay Dealers agreed that banking sector paper which constitutes a significant part of the market was currently under pressure Floating rate debt of major U S And Canadian banks eased markedly in nervous trading last month on renewed investor fears about the banks exposure to Latin American debt The U S And Canadian money centre bank FRNs along with Republic of Ireland paper were hard hit again this week with dealers citing one heavily traded Citicorp note falling to levels so low it is now effectively yielding 55 basis points over Libor the London Interbank Offered Rate By comparison the 500 mln dlr note which matures in 1998 yielded only a fine 20 basis point over Libid the London Interbank Bid Rate when it was issued in January last year Price declines of this size can really only be explained by an understanding of the operating practices of leading players in the market dealers and banking analysts said This has to be understood as a matter between banks who have a brief to buy low and sell high one U S Bank source noted Another senior source at a U K Bank drew attention to the enormous overhead costs and high salaries generated over the last few years in the FRN market which have to be justified But even beyond the cost of running an FRN trading desk dealers said is the way the securities are bought and sold Although sophisticated on screen dealing exists in most markets in the euro markets trading is conducted by telephone If somebody calls you up and asks you to make him a price in any issue and you do he can say Right You own five mln a trader said explaining market practice The unfortunate buyer is then forced to unload the securities just minutes later to yet another firm at an even lower price the trader explained It is precisely this phenomenon that forced the rapid downward price spiral earlier today traders said adding that it is likely to continue until the markets either regain their confidence or market practices change One possible solution dealers said would be to initiate trading exclusively through brokers screens so that only those who wanted to buy bonds would have to lift a bid or buy at that price Meanwhile bank regulators are apparently concerned about the implications of the collapse in FRN prices Traders in London said that the Bank of England has called around to market makers asking whether they intended to continue trading and what they calculated the losses to be The Bank often makes periodic checks in the market but dealers said the latest enquiries were more specific A spokesman for the Bank of England was not able to comment immediately on the Bank s action One trader at a major U S Bank here said that in addition the Federal Reserve Bank of New York s international capital markets unit has phoned banks in London today seeking information about trading in FRN s He also said that this was not an unusual procedure Reuter

427095,"FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U S FEBRUARY ECONOMY By Kathleen Hays Reuters NEW YORK March 13 U S February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy economists said If you re the Fed there s no reason to do anything said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc There are hints that GNP is picking up On the inflation front all is well he said Money supply is well under control It s an absolutely ideal situation February U S industrial production rose 0 5 pct slightly less than the 0 7 pct gain the financial markets had expected This compared with a slim 0 1 pct rise in January s production number previously reported as a 0 4 pct increase The February U S producer price index gained only 0 1 pct less than a 0 3 0 4 pct expected rise This followed a 0 6 pct rise in the PPI in January The Fed is going to look at this positively said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker Fed Chairman has said lately Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants The energy products component of PPI rose 4 0 pct in February after a 9 8 pct increase in January This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc The trend is still 3 5 pct in the first half of the year In 1986 declining energy prices contributed to a 2 5 pct decline in the PPI Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected but a sharp drop in auto prices was not Passenger car prices fell 3 4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1 3 pct Yesterday Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air he said We need inflation for U S producers to compete with foreign producers Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0 8 pct in February s PPI With many electronic goods produced overseas this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for U S competitiveness he said If further dollar declines are needed this could diminish overseas investment in U S debt Brusca added which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices By contrast Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11 8 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987 Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 8 5 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986 which has contributed to rising U S industrial output It s the other side of the lower dollar Wyss said Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 0 3 0 4 pct in the first quarter It s an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production Utilities output rose 0 7 pct in February after gaining 1 2 pct in January but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced not that manufacturing activity gained Finally he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 8 3 million units at an annual rate from 7 5 million units In the first quarter it looks like automakers are producing at an 8 5 mln unit annual rate but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate Roach said The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U S business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987 January business inventories rose 0 9 pct the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 1 7 pct the Commerce Department said Business sales dropped 4 5 pct in January the largest monthly sales drop on record Nonetheless economists do not expect the Fed to react to month to month changes The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months Ramirez said

427230,"HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT By David Lewis Reuters BUDAPEST March 11 National Bank of Hungary first vice president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year s severe trade deficit with the West Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade It is useful to have a devaluation he said There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5 5 pct in 1986 This was partly an after effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s he added Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year But the country s hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539 4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295 3 mln in 1986 and 1 2 billion in 1985 Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs One Western commercial attache here said Devaluation of itself will not change anything It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market Hungary s net hard currency debt soared to 7 79 billion dlrs last year from 5 01 billion in 1985 partly because of a current account deficit of 1 42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation I am for credits to invest for that purpose he said I am against credits for consumption He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year from one pct in 1986 Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market where he considered rates to be low Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3 5 billion dlrs he said On the budget deficit which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985 Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43 8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints REUTER ",TEST:hungary,0,0.00743034055727554,0.0953560371517028,0.189473684210526,0,0,0,0.00185758513931889,0,0.0123839009287926,0.00123839009287926,0,0.000619195046439629,0.000619195046439629,0,0.00495356037151703,0.000619195046439629,0.0111455108359133,0.00123839009287926,0.00619195046439629,0.021671826625387,0.000619195046439629,0,0.00495356037151703,0.00681114551083591,0,0.0594427244582043,0.00619195046439629,0,0,0.000619195046439629,0.00619195046439629,0,0.000619195046439629,0,0,0.0563467492260062,0.00804953560371517,0.00123839009287926,0.0235294117647059,0.000619195046439629,0.000619195046439629,0.00247678018575851,0.038390092879257,0.00123839009287926,0.244582043343653,0,0,0.0148606811145511,0.000619195046439629,0,0.021671826625387,0.00247678018575851,0.0291021671826625,0,0,0.000619195046439629,0.112693498452012,0.000619195046439629

427374,"U S RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND ANALYSTS By Kathleen Hays Reuters NEW YORK March 12 U S retail sales rose sharply in February but many economists said the underlying consumer spending trend remains weak February retail sales jumped 4 1 pct more than the 2 5 3 0 pct rise the financial markets had anticipated But January s sales were revised down to a 7 4 pct drop from a previously reported 5 8 pct decline The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a much more sluggish pace said Don Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing Combining the latest data with a 0 6 pct drop in November and a 4 6 pct gain in December the average retail sales gain over the four months was 0 2 pct he said compared to to a 0 4 pct rise for year over year sales through February You can see a pattern developing Maude said I wouldn t be surprised to see a fall off in March especially since sales probably won t be boosted by auto sales as they were in February Despite the weak underlying trend economists were impressed by a robust 1 5 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in February This compared to a revised 0 4 pct decline in January previously reported as a 0 1 pct decline The increase in non auto sales was broadbased with gains in durable goods as well as non durables noted Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc It was a pretty healthy report He noted that building materials rose 1 8 pct in February after falling 1 7 pct in January General merchandise store sales gained 1 4 pct after a 1 6 pct rise in January There are signs of life in the economy McCarthy said But it s jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future A 0 7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in February he said A lot of people may be inadvertently under withholding taxes from their paychecks he said When people in this country get an increase in disposable income the inclination is to go out and spend it he said Economists said tomorrow s release of U S auto sales for the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending Auto sales accounted for the lion s share of total February sales rising 14 4 pct This followed a 27 7 pct drop in January previously reported as a 22 4 pct fall due largely to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws January 1 the Commerce Department noted Some economists argued that the because the gain in total sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January the strength in the February report is less than impressive There is strength in the February data but that s because they were compared to low sales levels in January said said Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc We don t see it as a precursor of continued strength Durable goods sales rose 8 8 pct in February after falling 17 7 pct in January February non durable goods sales gained 1 3 pct after declining 0 2 pct in January Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February following a 1 9 pct gain in January but economists said higher oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales probably accounted for these gains Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending is weakening Total retail sales on average were 123 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 she said In January they fell to a seasonally adjusted 117 52 bilion dlrs and in February rose to 122 29 billion dlrs On average it looks like they ll total 120 to 121 mln dlrs in the first quartrer she said We don t look at this as indication that the economy is barrelling along The number is not really that problematic for those of us who are constructive on the bond market agreed Elliot Platt of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so confusing he said

427388,"FRN MARKET SLUMPS FIXED RATE EUROBOND TRADE QUIET By Dominique Jackson Reuters LONDON March 12 Eurobond prices in the floating rate note sector slumped across the board by as much as a full point on some issues Today has been irrational irresponsible possibly the worst day in what has been a dire six months for the floater market commented a senior FRN trader at a U K Bank Republic of Ireland FRNs were marked sharply down in initial trading and market nerves soon infected other supra national and sovereign paper with dealers attributing the falls to aggressive professional shorting by a few leading U S Investment houses The FRN market has been suffering from acute contraction of liquidity and consequent drain of investor confidence since the effective collapse in the market for perpetual floating rate issues late last year Since then FRN specialists noted that retail interest has been sparse or completely absent and the stagnant market for floating rate paper has become increasingly vulnerable to manipulation with nerves affecting all variety of borrowers Floating rate debt of U S And Canadian banks came under pressure last month when fears resurfaced about their exposure to Latin American debt Canadian banks were hard hit today Fears about the Irish economy exacerbated by recent post electoral political wrangling in Dublin prompted a sell off of Ireland paper this morning with both dollar and mark denominated Irish issues tumbling by a full point or more However FRN dealers polled by Reuters felt the Irish issues had been singled out as the U S And Canadian banks were most recently as the market s most vulnerable sector A handful of professional houses are targetting the weak paper shorting it aggressively and this is just starting the domino effect with basically sound paper also starting to roll with it a senior FRN market source explained Although floating paper from better regarded borrowers such as the U K Managed to finish the day only around 10 basis points down other sovereigns like Sweden and supranationals like Eurofima suffered heavier losses FRN dealers said Debt exposure fears continued to undermine U S And Canadian bank paper with one U K House citing a fall of 1 5 8 point on the day on a Royal Bank of Canada issue FRN traders noted Japanese investors initially enthusiastic floating rate debt buyers had lost confidence in the market and speculated that a crisis meeting such as the one called upon the collapse of the perpetuals could be imminent Retail clients just don t want to know about the floaters any more so it has degenerated to a wily pass the parcel among the professionals all scheming to sweep the paper under the carpet another senior FRN trader said I don t know what is going to happen to the market It can t go on like this he added In the fixed rate sector trading was dull with the market still attempting to digest a heavy volume of new issues from earlier this week although primary market activity slowed somewhat today trading and syndicate sources reported Dollar straight bonds ended the day barely changed from opening levels as investors failed to react on the unexpectedly large 4 1 pct rise in U S February retail sales prefering to wait for tomorrow s producer price and business inventory data A 100 mln dlr deal for Norsk Hydro was launched later in the day and the issue was trading around its total two pct fees at close of grey market trade although dealers said the borrower s frequent appearance in the euromarkets could deter investors The Canadian dollar sector however saw good two way trade and a continuation of recent healthy volume as the Canadian dollar rides high on the foreign exchanges and futures markets Dealers said the strength of the Canadian dollar which has firmed especially over the last two days has renewed end investors confidence in the currency A new Canadian dollar issue for Hydro Quebec was seeing excellent demand sector specialists said and the issue was quickly increased to a total of 150 mln dlrs from 125 mln This kind of paper can be hard to sell and it is gratifying to see such a high level of interest both

427413,"TALKING POINT PUROLATOR COURIER CORP PCC By Patti Domm Reuter New York March 12 Purolator Courier corp s stock rose on specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would find a new suitor for the company traders said Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr a share 265 mln dlr offer from E F Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of its Purolator courier division s management The stock today hit 36 1 4 up one Today Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10 The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a better deal Gardner said he believes a better offer might be found if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity or if it could sell off all or part of its U S courier division Basically the courier division is a company that has 450 mln dlrs in revenues It s a very large company and it s being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs said Gardner in a telephone interview with Reuters Gardner is an official of Kelso Management a firm associated with Fidelity International Ltd A group of Fidelity companies owns eight pct of Purolator and Gardner said he personally owns 20 000 shares A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the letter from Gardner Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator Before the transaction with Hutton LBO was announced analysts had also speculated another courier company would be the most likely suitor While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no new bidders he said the possibility one could appear pushed the stock into play again There s no shortage of possibilities It s just a question of management s willingness to let the process continue said one arbitrager Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs cash per share The balance of Purolator s stock will be bought for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U S courier operations The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and will emerge with a giant majority equity interest in Purolator As far as I can tell from the public documents from the deal that s on the table Hutton is basically putting up zero One always likes a situation like that You always like to think if they can do this deal at no risk there should be someone else in the world that could do it higher said one arbitrager The firm however is supplying temporary financing and sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the firm will not end up paying for its equity position While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document did note that the E F Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to keep cash in the transaction the sources said there is some risk to the firm There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash and all sorts of things that make it very speculative said one of the sources adding there are also severance payments to employees The E F Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs in so called bridge financing for the transaction The bridge financing is a temporary loan from Hutton The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing expected to come from banks However it may take some time to replace the financing the source said resulting in what could be a substantial expense to the firm Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln dlrs from the transaction but sources close to the transaction said fees are at the low end of the scale It s a very complex transaction but basically what happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture any investment they might have once the merger takes place Gardner said Reuter

427508,"U S FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT By Greg McCune Reuters WASHINGTON March 13 A secondary market for resale of farm real estate loans similar to markets on home mortgages is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could be set up this year Congressional and financial sources said Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market have been introduced in both the House and Senate Furthermore Representatives of the Farm Credit System commercial bankers and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree on a method of establishing the market Frank Naylor chairman of the Farm Credit Administration FCA which regulates the farm credit system yesterday said a farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture as long as the farm credit system is a key player Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the secondary market could be established either with Congressional legislation or administratively Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the successful resale markets in home mortgages the Government National Mortgage Association GNMA and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac industry sources said Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main supporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in rural lending with the quasi government farm credit system traditionally the largest lender to farmers A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell high quality loans on farmland to poolers who in turn would package the loans and issue farm mortgage backed securities for resale to investors called Aggie mae by some proponents The FCA and financially troubled farm credit system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea mainly because any farm secondary market established in the private sector which excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to the system which has lost 4 6 billion dlrs in two years Naylor and farm credit system officials have said However the system and FCA have become more positive to the idea recently because the system could benefit if it were appointed the agent for a secondary market If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools of farm mortgage loans it would benefit from the fees charged for providing this service the Life Insurers study said Congressional sources believe a secondary market available to both private lenders and the farm credit system with the system as agent could be included in a major federal government rescue package for the system to be drafted by Congress later this year A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the secondary market idea the American Council of Life Insurers concludes that the farm credit system s market share in rural lending would fall if a secondary market were established The study was released earlier today The study said a secondary market could be established with virtually no federal money if the government provided a guarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a private co insurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of the eight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year would qualify for the secondary market in the first few years expanding significantly later as investors accept the idea The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who meet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would fall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why leading U S farm organizations such as the American Farm Bureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea Proponents say a secondary market also would increase liquidity in farm lending and spread the risk of such loans Reuter ",TEST:usa,0.0762148337595908,0.00767263427109974,0.0286445012787724,0.00051150895140665,0.00153452685421995,0,0.0020460358056266,0.00051150895140665,0,0.115089514066496,0.0439897698209719,0,0.00153452685421995,0.00460358056265985,0,0.0020460358056266,0,0.00051150895140665,0.106393861892583,0.0010230179028133,0.0117647058823529,0.00051150895140665,0.0296675191815857,0.0051150895140665,0,0.0061381074168798,0.00051150895140665,0.0117647058823529,0.00051150895140665,0,0.110997442455243,0.00460358056265985,0.00051150895140665,0.0132992327365729,0,0.0051150895140665,0.0332480818414322,0.00971867007672634,0,0,0.00153452685421995,0.00255754475703325,0.00153452685421995,0,0.0143222506393862,0.172890025575448,0.00818414322250639,0.0107416879795396,0.0040920716112532,0,0.0010230179028133,0.0951406649616368,0,0.0301790281329923,0,0,0.00153452685421995,0.00051150895140665,0.0199488491048593
