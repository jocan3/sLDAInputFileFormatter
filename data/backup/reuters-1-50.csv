429239,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT By Brian Childs Reuters PARIS March 16 A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies Company profits and the stock market are rising But so is unemployment Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation held to a 20 year low of 2 1 pct in 1986 is uncertain Forced last month to cut the government s 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year France s economic performance led by a mixed cast of right wing ministers and a socialist President has won mixed reviews from non partisan analysts For Michel Develle Director of Economic Studies at newly privatised Banque Paribas the government s outstanding achievement has been to launch a veritable intellectual revolution breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control The figures may look mediocre neither good nor bad but set in their context of structural reforms they are excellent Develle said But some analysts say they fear that Balladur chief architect of the government s free market policies may be pursuing a mirage The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval Personally I think it s an illusion Dirigisme direction is a basic fact of the French system from school onwards Ultra liberalism is impossible Illusion or not the government has pushed its vision hard Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state owned banks and industries to private investors Since December nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas PARI PA and glass maker Cie de Saint Gobain SA SGEP PA the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five year privatisation plan Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital and the lifting of most currency controls money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12 5 pct since December At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy The immediate result was a 0 9 pct rise in consumer prices in January partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast to 2 5 pct from two pct or less But even 2 5 pct would be a fantastic result when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945 commented Develle of Paribas Other achievements include a major reduction in the state s foreign debts and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141 1 billion francs last year 2 5 billion francs below target and down from 153 3 billion in 1985 But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark its second since Chirac took power A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted Outside the mainly state controlled high technology sectors French industrial goods were increasingly ill adapted to demand and over priced the report said French economists including Cheval at Indosuez agreed with the report One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom the employers will invest and modernise But nine out of ten will say yes they like freedom and then wait to be told which way to go he said And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment the end 1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2 7 million some 300 000 more than a year earlier The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year s oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan they say REUTER

429422,"U K BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT LONDON March 17 Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson presenting his budget for fiscal 1987 88 to Parliament said U K Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987 He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2 5 billion stg after a 1 1 billion shortfall in 1986 Inflation is expected to be 4 0 pct at the end of this year Lawson said As I forecast in the Autumn Statement inflation may continue to edge up for a time perhaps exceeding 4 5 pct by the summer before falling back to 4 0 pct by the end of the year he added Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement PSBR Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986 87 was 4 0 billion stg or 1 0 pct of GDP The planned PSBR for 1987 88 was set at 4 0 billion stg On monetary policy Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987 88 No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate he said But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as of course will the exchange rate the Chancellor told Parliament Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986 87 is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non oil tax revenues in general and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular On oil prices Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987 He said it is clear that the increased flow of non oil tax revenues coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure puts the public finances in a very strong position Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1 0 pct of GDP in future We have reached what I judge to be the Medium Term Financial Strategy s appropriate destination a PSBR of 1 0 pct of GDP My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead Lawson said Inevitably this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation which of course remains a major objective of government policy But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution and to build a still firmer base for the future Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book On corporation tax he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987 88 But companies capital gains will be charged at the appropriate corporation tax rate He said that under the new proposed system companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax ACT payments against tax on capital gains Taken together these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988 89 Lawson said Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax to be known as Pay and File This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection and would not come into force until the early 1990s Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT As from today companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their PRT liabilities in existing fields until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred Second there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U K Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field On business employment Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers Lawson said that in future traders registered for Value Added Tax VAT would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days he added and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21 300 stg New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance he added The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125 000 stg Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment The change will take effect on April 1 1987 but genuine trading companies will not be affected He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans also from April 1 In future banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan he said The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence to 27 pct from 29 pct Lawson reiterated the government s aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound but added given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR that goal cannot be achieved in this budget Small companies corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct he said On the Lloyd s insurance market Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd s syndicates bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd s about the details of the legislation he said The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd s account which closes on December 31 this year Lawson said MORE

429593,"SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT By Richard Jarvie Reuters RIO DE JANEIRO March 18 Latin American sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production official and trade sources said Although prices have risen to around eight from five U S Cents per lb in the past six months they are still below the region s nine to ten cents per lb average production cost The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert Manuel Rico a consultant with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries GEPLACEA told Reuters However Rico said it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable he said Officials in Mexico Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production but industry leaders in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go The prices are ridiculous said Julian Mateo vice president of Costa Rica s Sugar Cane Industrial Agricultural League At current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output given the instability of world markets An official at Colombia s National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets The market is very unstable What is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything In 1985 the latest year for which full figures are available Central and South American nations produced 28 mln tonnes raw value of sugar of which 12 3 mln were exported A year earlier they had produced and exported about 800 000 more according to the London based International Sugar Organization Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover Miguel Guerrero director of the Dominican Republic s National Sugar Institute said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply Output had slumped to under 450 000 tonnes a year from 900 000 in the late 1970s Obsolete refineries poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output he added Plans of nearby Cuba the world s largest cane sugar exporter to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious trade sources said Output is running well below the record 8 6 mln produced in 1970 Cuba suffers from run down plantations harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries under special deals Last year bad weather added to its troubles and output fell to 7 2 mln tonnes from 8 2 mln in 1985 The low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover U S And in the case of some Caribbean countries European Community EC import quotas for which they receive prices well above free market levels Progressive reductions in the U S Quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market Peru for example shipped 96 000 tonnes to the U S In both 1983 and 1984 This fell to 76 000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37 000 A national cooperative official said that as long as world market levels continue at around half of Peru s production cost the future of the industry is uncertain At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which according to the group s executive secretary Eduardo Latorre grows like a weed throughout the region Brazil the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes uses over half to produce alcohol fuel Cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency The difference in the price the state run Sugar and Alcohol Institute IAA pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year coupled with a drought reduced cane crop has meant Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987 trade sources said Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year with the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles However the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little hope for the region s sugar industry to return to profitability unless the U S And EC change their policies The agricultural policies of the European Community and of the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries Brazil s Trade and Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA meeting The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets GEPLACEA officials say this is the main cause of low prices GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region s industry out of steady decline Such an agreement would have to have both U S And EC backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact They have to realise that the more our economies suffer the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region s 360 billion dollar foreign debt GEPLACEA s Latorre said Reuter

429719,"AFTER G 6 ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS By Claire Miller Reuters NEW YORK March 13 Central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange market s first test of the industrialized nations recent pact to stabilize currencies analysts said In active trading this week the market pushed the dollar sterling the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure So far G 6 has been a roaring success said James O Neill financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA The central banks are sending strong signals that they won t tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies added a senior corporate trader at one U K bank On February 22 the finance ministers and central bank governors of the U S Japan West Germany France and the U K the Group of Five plus Canada signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two year decline against major world currencies And initially traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower But by Wednesday the dollar climbed to more than 1 87 marks about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G 6 accord The move was aided by indications that the U S economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G 6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines Dealers differed as to whether the U S central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 1 87 marks or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions But the dollar quickly backed off It hovered today around 1 85 marks The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon said Marine Midland NA s O Neill Also on Wednesday London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U K currency rose to 1 60 dlrs compared with 1 5355 dlrs before the G 6 pact Sterling along with the other high yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar mark and dollar yen The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving U K economy anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election There was a real run on sterling said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc Sterling traded today around 1 5750 dlrs down from 1 5870 dlrs last night It slid to 2 917 marks from 2 950 yesterday and from a peak of about 2 98 recently There s been some heavy profit taking on sterling mark ahead of next Tuesday s U K budget said James McGroarty of Discount Corp As speculators detected the presence of the U S and British central banks they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars But here too they were stymied The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency s rise The Canadian dollar traded at 1 3218 23 per U S dollar today down from 1 3185 90 yesterday And the Australian Reserve Bank using the Fed as agent sold Australian dollars in the U S yesterday dealers said The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67 45 55 U S cents today from a high of 69 02 Thursday Analysts said the central banks moves to stifle sudden upward movement leave the market uncertain about its next step Today the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months The dollar fell to 152 35 40 yen from 153 35 40 last night Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling short mark positions established lately Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen a dealer at one U K bank said Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders lower industrial output and slowing employment gains Moreover the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas for example in Australian financial instruments repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 Noting that the dollar yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large U S trade deficit with Japan analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar s downward scope against the Japanese currency In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of January the Federal Reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28 On that day the dollar fell as low as 150 40 yen Sure the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in January But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and

in world prices analysts and industry sources said A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while so far European Community EC growers plan unchanged to lower areas increases are expected in some Eastern European nations Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F O Licht Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this In recent years good autumn weather has given yields a late boost making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so called C sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC A and B quotas which receive full and partial price support respectively Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices However with the EC budget stretched to breaking point this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic A and B quotas they added In France the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year s 421 000 hectares nine pct below the previous year The basic trend is towards stability a FIRS spokesman said Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels he said Beet sugar output last year was 3 37 mln tonnes with an average yield of 8 00 tonnes per ha the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8 52 the previous year and a five year average 8 11 In West Germany recent price rises have not altered plans since planting decisions were taken a few months ago industry sources said The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385 000 hectares against 399 000 last year British Sugar Plc the monopoly beet processor has signed up U K Farmers to grow 8 1 mln tonnes of beet This should yield about 1 25 mln tonnes of whites Last year s crop equalled the second highest ever at 1 32 mln tonnes British Sugar has A and B quotas totalling 1 144 mln tonnes of whites and its C output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease resistant seed types Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans Wincenty Nowicki a deputy director of Cukropol the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises said World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level The national plan set before prices began to rise put plantings this year at 460 000 hectares against 425 000 in 1986 Nowicki said Last year production was 1 74 mln tonnes World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market an official at the national beet growers association said Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year s 270 000 ha especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya Beet output last season of 15 5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1 72 mln tonnes of white sugar Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130 000 ha from a record 137 600 in 1986 as a new self imposed quota system comes into force a spokesman for Centrale Suiker the second largest Dutch sugar processor said The new system aims for an average of around 915 000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of C sugar Last year the Netherlands produced a record 1 2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined A and B quota of only 872 000 tonnes The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of C sugar really worthwhile the spokesman said Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged Licht put this year s Soviet beet area at 3 40 mln ha against 3 44 mln last year Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105 000 ha from some 95 000 in 1986 the official MTI news agency said but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180 000 ha this year A spokesman for Denmark s largest beet concern De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A S said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365 000 tonnes from a steady area of 60 000 ha In Sweden where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand the planted area is seen little changed at 51 000 ha against 51 300 last year according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB Last year Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36 400 hectares down from 37 600 in 1986 REUTER

429765,"COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS By Douglas Learmond Reuters LONDON March 16 The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market government delegates and trade experts said Only two weeks ago world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated This week many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council ITC which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations The ITC s failure has restricted negotiators ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built in flaws or unlimited liability but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought One consumer country delegate said this would distort not support the market Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the must buy level of 1 600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100 000 tonnes of cocoa enough to mount large buying or selling operations were carried forward from the previous agreement Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade It has an upper limit of 250 000 tonnes The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters and the full council meets on Thursday Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non member countries such as Malaysia Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium priced high quality cocoas The argument over buying non member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non member cocoa and that it use the London futures market s existing differentials for different qualities Currently good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market Discounts which are currently under review range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand forcing all prices lower The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community a key ICCO consumer group with France siding with producers EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and a diplomatic source said narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there One ICCO delegate describing the producer consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is meant to support the market where trade buying is not In contrast he said producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers Other more technical issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced posted price as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers In either case delegates said it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers REUTER

429803,"TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR FIGHT IN U S CONGRESS By Jacqueline Frank Reuters WASHINGTON March 16 U S lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April In a move to toughen U S enforcement of trade laws a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year s record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to get tough with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U S products On the other hand congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan s hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee s bill was not one that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects but he emphasized there was a consensus among trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements You ll find a lot of people who think we have not done the former enough You ll find poeple who think we haven t avoided violating agreements In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U S economy Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski an Illinois Democrat insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill As an indication of his success White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still did not like some provisions But he added Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation I think we are progressing very well The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep Richard Gephardt a Missouri Democrat to force countries such as Japan South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the United States The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices but would not automatically set off retaliation Rep Phil Crane an Illinois Republican and staunch free trader said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition AFL CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a statement I m not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland I m trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president In writing the bill the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles Rep Ed Jenkins a Democrat from Georgia agreed to hold off his fight He intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry an aide said Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year House Speaker Jim Wright a Texas Democrat is one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption For the most part the trade bill s provisions toughen U S enforcement of trade laws The bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost of production It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence Congressmen said the change would have required the U S International Trade Commission to impose limits on car imports in 1981 Reuter

429826,"ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION By Peter Cooney Reuters TORONTO March 16 Royal Trustco Ltd in a move unique among Canadian trust companies is pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to 50 pct president Michael Cornelissen said First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trust s international growth target is attainable But it will be a tremendous achievement because they re going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies Walsh said Global operations which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust s 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990 Royal Trust Canada s second largest trust company with assets of about 19 54 billion Canadian dlrs has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s when other Canadian trusts the equivalent of U S savings and loans were focusing on domestic retail banking The company s overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations which attained full British banking powers in 1980 Cornelissen said Last year Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co DOW s Dow Financial Services Corp which included asset management merchant and private banking companies It was a heaven sent opportunity Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage in order to exploit profitable niches overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management private banking and advisory services He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations before the end of this month to sell its London based Savory Milln brokerage acquired in the Dow Financial deal The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business he said adding that in trust type services we don t think the international markets are well served Aiding Royal Trust s foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad Cornelissen said Central to Royal Trust s strategy is Asia boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital said Cornelissen whose company administers assets of 71 85 billion dlrs more than any other Canadian trust Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000 Asia will contain two thirds of the world s population and 50 pct of global productive capacity Cornelissen said We knew we had to be there Royal Trust s 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo Hong Kong and Singapore The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the immediate future although we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities Asked about Royal Trust s plans for the U S which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks That doesn t mean to say we shouldn t be in the U S said Cornelissen That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks trusts insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another s actitivies will mean more domestic competition for Royal Trust but not drastically more Cornelissen said Reuter

430062,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS By JEFF STEARNS REUTERS TOKYO March 18 More U S And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters Already rich Japanese companies have pounced on U S Banks steel and other businesses In the latest attempt Fujitsu Ltd ITSU T Japan s biggest computer maker unsuccessfully bid for Fairchild Semiconductor Corp a U S Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers Nomura Securities Co Ltd NMSC T and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd DSEC T Japan s two largest brokerage firms are seeking a niche in the U S And European securities markets while the country s huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking the takeover specialists said Major trading houses which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists Among manufacturers car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses especially in the U S Japan s largest market and where political risks are minimal a takeover specialist at one trading company said Japanese companies have become among the world s richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months But the yen s strength which has also raised the costs of Japan s exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets has frozen Japanese corporate growth the specialists said Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work Domestic interest rates now at record lows offer little investment opportunity Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous but the recent economic factors have become a driving force said a banking industry source So far though the Japanese are being cautious While mergers and acquisitions among U S Firms number in the thousands Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen one merchant banker said Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now but that time span appeared now to be too long Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now he said A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc s Sun Chemical Corp of the U S Last year which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile he added Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical s graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts related businesses Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese the trading company official says Japanese people don t like fighting They prefer peaceful amicable deals But now after some experience overseas Japanese companies are acquainted with

430224,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY By Stephen Jukes Reuters RIYADH March 19 Higher world oil prices coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity could lift Saudi Arabia s economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits bankers and diplomats said The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct the first rise since 1982 But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC s newly established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day bpd well down on Saudi Arabia s OPEC quota of 4 13 mln set for the first half of 1987 King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC s new found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom s need to secure a stable source of income for its economy Saudi Arabia still the world s largest oil exporter is a hugely wealthy country But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8 6 pct in 1985 Oil revenue last year when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel probably totalled no more than 17 5 billion dlrs compared to a peak 101 8 billion in 1981 Austerity is still the watchword but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects a diplomat said In the short term the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves still put at around 100 billion dlrs But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to tough it out on the oil front even if that means a short term depletion of reserves The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52 7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy he said Reserves were built up during the late 1970 s and early 1980 s when Saudi Arabia s breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom s private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks hit hard by non performing loans to the corporate sector have become highly selective in extending new credit Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation s industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad REUTER
